# Service Bindings for Kubernetes

Service Bindings for Kubernetes implements the [Service Binding Specification for Kubernetes](https://github.com/k8s-service-bindings/spec). We are tracking changes to the spec as it approaches a stable release (currently targeting [pre-RC3](https://github.com/k8s-service-bindings/spec/tree/12a9f2e376c50f051cc9aa913443bdecb0a24a01)). Backwards and forwards compatibility should not be expected for alpha versioned resources.

This implementation provides support for:
- [Provisioned Service](https://github.com/k8s-service-bindings/spec/tree/12a9f2e376c50f051cc9aa913443bdecb0a24a01#provisioned-service)
- [Workload Projection](https://github.com/k8s-service-bindings/spec/tree/12a9f2e376c50f051cc9aa913443bdecb0a24a01#workload-projection)
- [Service Binding](https://github.com/k8s-service-bindings/spec/tree/12a9f2e376c50f051cc9aa913443bdecb0a24a01#service-binding)
- [Direct Secret Reference](https://github.com/k8s-service-bindings/spec/tree/12a9f2e376c50f051cc9aa913443bdecb0a24a01#direct-secret-reference)
- [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://github.com/k8s-service-bindings/spec/tree/12a9f2e376c50f051cc9aa913443bdecb0a24a01#role-based-access-control-rbac)

The following are not supported:
- [Workload Resource Mapping](https://github.com/k8s-service-bindings/spec/tree/12a9f2e376c50f051cc9aa913443bdecb0a24a01#workload-resource-mapping)
- Extensions including:
  - [Binding Secret Generation Strategies](https://github.com/k8s-service-bindings/spec/tree/12a9f2e376c50f051cc9aa913443bdecb0a24a01#binding-secret-generation-strategies)

## Troubleshooting

Service Bindings for Kubernetes is an implementation of the Service Binding Specification for Kubernetes, If any trouble shows up please refer to the troubleshooting guide [here](troubleshooting.md).

## Resources

### ServiceBinding (servicebinding.io/v1alpha3)

The `ServiceBinding` resource shape and behavior is defined by the spec.

```
apiVersion: servicebinding.io/v1alpha3
kind: ServiceBinding
metadata:
  name: account-db
spec:
  service:
    apiVersion: bindings.labs.vmware.com/v1alpha1
    kind: ProvisionedService
    name: account-db
  workload:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: account-service
```

### ProvisionedService (bindings.labs.vmware.com/v1alpha1)

The `ProvisionedService` exposes a resource `Secret` by implementing the upstream [Provisioned Service duck type](https://github.com/k8s-service-bindings/spec#provisioned-service), and may be the target of the `.spec.service` reference for a `ServiceBinding`. It is intended for compatibility with existing services that do not directly implement the duck type.

For example to expose a service with an existing `Secret` named `account-db-service`:

```
apiVersion: bindings.labs.vmware.com/v1alpha1
kind: ProvisionedService
metadata:
  name: account-db
spec:
  binding:
    name: account-db-service

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: account-db-service
type: Opaque
stringData:
  type: mysql
  # use appropriate values
  host: localhost
  database: default
  password: ""
  port: "3306"
  username: root
```

The controller writes the resource's status to implement the duck type.
